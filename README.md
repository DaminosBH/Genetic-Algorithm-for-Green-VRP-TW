# Genetic Algorithm for Green VRP-TW
Implementation of green VRP-TW algorithms using a Genetic Algorithm. The algorithm is tested using SOLOMON INSTANCES.

## Genetic Algorithms for Green VRP-TW
Genetic Algorithms for solving the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP). This practical assignment requires developing, using Python, an implementation of genetic algorithms for solving the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP).

The developed algorithm is a combination of genetic algorithms with nearest neighbor initialization and local search techniques, extensively explored in the context of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) and related optimization problems.
