# Genetic Algorithm for Green VRP-TW
Implementation of green VRP-TW algorithms using a Genetic Algorithm. The algorithm is tested using SOLOMON INSTANCES.

## Genetic Algorithms for Green VRP-TW
Genetic Algorithms for solving the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP). This practical assignment requires developing, using Python, an implementation of genetic algorithms for solving the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP).

The developed algorithm is a combination of genetic algorithms with nearest neighbor initialization and local search techniques, extensively explored in the context of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) and related optimization problems.

## What's New
- **Initialization of Population with Nearest Neighbors Search**: Enhanced initial population generation using nearest neighbor heuristic to improve starting solutions.
- **Integration of Local Search Algorithm**: Incorporates local search techniques to refine solutions and enhance the genetic algorithm's performance.
- **GREEN VRP-TW**:The evaluation of the VRP Aims to minimize emissions rather than distance
- **MEET / NAEI Emission Models**: The vehicle Emission can be calcultaed using NAEI or MEET model depending on the application or the needs of the user.

##  Usage
Follow these instructions to test the project locally.

1- select the Emission model by commenting or uncommenting one of the coded models in the evaluation function in core.py ( by default the code uses the MEET Emission Model.
2- Run TEST.py
